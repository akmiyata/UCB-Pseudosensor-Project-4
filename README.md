# UCB-Pseudosensor-Project-4
This is the second project in "M2M and IoT Interface Design and Protocols" (ECEA 5348), the final weather pseudosensor project (a little variety, please?). Thankfully, almost everything in this project was brand new tech to me (besides Python). I have included five files:

1. UCB5348-Pseudosensor-Project2.pdf: Project overview, including requirements, assumptions, and other notes, as well as screenshots of the UI in several scenarios.
2. Lambda Gateway Send.py:
3. Lambda to DDB.py: 
4. publish.py: 
5. getWeather.py: 

# What I learned
Similar to UCB-Pseudosensor-Project-3; much of the tech in this project was totally foreign to me. I love a challenge, and I love learning, so I think this was my favorite project in the series.
