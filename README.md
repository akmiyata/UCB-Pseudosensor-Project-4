# UCB-Pseudosensor-Project-4
This is the second project in "M2M and IoT Interface Design and Protocols" (ECEA 5348), the final weather pseudosensor project (a little variety, please?). Thankfully, almost everything in this project was brand new tech to me (besides Python). I have included five files:

1. UCB5348-Pseudosensor-Project2.pdf: Project overview, including requirements, assumptions, and other notes, as well as screenshots of the UI in several scenarios.
2. Lambda Gateway Send.py:
3. Lambda to DDB.py: 
4. publish.py: 
5. getWeather.py: 
What I learned
Unlike prior projects, there was a lot of unfamiliar tech here for me. Just learning to use AWS certificates took much more time than I anticipated. Boto3 was also new to me, but like most other libraries, it didn't take too long to figure out how to use tools for my specific application.

Initially I thought the biggest hurdle for me would be adjusting to the Cloud9 IDE, since I'm so used to VSCode, but Amazon did a great job making the IDE user friendly and a fairly seemless transition from VSCode. I just wish other AWS tools were like that (see UCB-Pseudosensor-Project 4).
